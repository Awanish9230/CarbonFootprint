## 🚀 Installation Option 1

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version 18 or higher) ⚙️
*   npm (Node Package Manager) 📦
*   MongoDB (running locally or a connection string) 🍃

### Backend Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Awanish9230/CarbonFootprint.git
    cd CarbonFootprint
    ```
2.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
3.  Copy the example environment variables file and configure it:
    ```bash
    cp .env
    ```
    Edit the `.env` file with your MongoDB URI and JWT secret:
    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/carbon_footprint_tracker
    JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_secret
    ```
4.  Install the backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
5.  Run the backend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
6.  Seed the emission factors (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    node scripts/seedItems.js
    node scripts/seedEmissionFactors.js
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install the frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  The Vite dev server proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:5000` (configured in `vite.config.js`).

## 💡 Usage

1.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to access the application.

*   **Register** a new account or **Login** with an existing one.
*   **Log** your daily activities related to transportation, energy, shopping, and food.
*   **View** your carbon footprint trends and personalized recommendations on the dashboard.
*   **Participate** in community challenges and earn badges.
*   **Redeem** points in the marketplace for eco-friendly rewards.

## 🚀 Installation Option 2 — Run with Docker(Recommended)

### Prerequisites

*  Docker 🐳
*  Docker Compose 📦
No need to install Node.js or MongoDB manually. Everything runs inside containers.

###  Using Docker Setup
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/Awanish9230/CarbonFootprint.git
       cd CarbonFootprint
2.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following environment variables:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/carbonfootprint
    JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_secret
    PORT=5000
    ```
3.  Build and start the containers using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build

4. Access the application:
    Frontend → http://localhost:3000  
    Backend  → http://localhost:5000  
    MongoDB  → Running inside Docker container

5.  To stop the containers, run:
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```
 
💡Notes
The first build may take a few minutes.
* All backend, frontend, and database services run in isolated containers.
* Works identically on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
